When installing VirtualBox, the desired choice of version is important. Generally, you want to get the oldest version that will 
accomplish what you need. That way, there is less 'bloat'. Bloat being a relative term, because to run later and more 
sophisticated clients, you need more features, larger footprint, more bloat. On the other hand, relatively unsophisticated
clients may not show to advantage when paired with a VirtualBox version that is too advanced.


For the Mint 20.2 client on Windows 10, VirtualBox version 6.1.16 is a good choice. It is necessary to also get the Guest
 Editions of the same version number. The Guest Editions must be applied on a per client basis, that is, for each new client, 
it must be repeated. Double clicking the Guest Editions file does not seem to work effectively for getting it installed. It 
seems to be necessary to run the program from a terminal within the client.  Once Guest Editions have been successfully 
installed, the resolution can be checked. I have achieved a client resolution of 3282x1965 on Windows, where the parent
 resolution is 3840x2160.  Also, the Guest Editions feature of pass-thru clipboard pasting seems to work, after a fashion. 
Pass-thru is successful, but a change in the directory contents of either source or destination may require a client reboot to 
allow the paste. There are a couple of procedures in vogue for setting up pass-thru clipboard installation, you may have to try 
more than one to get success.


For the Mint 20.2 client on OSX 10.10, VirtualBox version 6.0.10 has been successfully used. The same comments as for 
Windows apply here. I have achieved a client resolution of 2788x1704, where the parent resolution is 2880x1800.
